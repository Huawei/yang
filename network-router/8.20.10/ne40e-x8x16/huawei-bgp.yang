The default router ID in the RM module is 0.0.0.0 when the router is not configured with any interface. 
             The rules for selecting a router ID are as follows:
             1. If you set a router ID through this configuration, the set router ID is used. If the router ID is not set, you need to select a router ID according to the following rules:
             (1) If loopback interfaces configured with IP addresses exist, the largest IP address among the IP addresses of the loopback interfaces is selected as the router ID.
             (2) If no loopback interface configured with an IP address exists, the largest IP address among the IP addresses of other interfaces is selected as the router ID, regardless of whether the interface is Up.
             The router ID is reselected only when the interface address that is selected as the router ID is deleted or changed. The router ID is not reselected in any of the following cases:
             a. The interface is Down.
             b. A loopback interface is configured when the IP address of a non-loopback interface is selected as the router ID.
             c. A larger IP address of an interface is configured.
             2. Each VPN instance selects the router ID from the addresses of the interfaces of the VPN instance according to the preceding rules.
             3. When both the AMB and SMB exist on the router, the system backs up the router ID set through the related command and the router ID that is selected from IP addresses of the interfaces. After the active/standby switchover is performed, the system checks the validity of the router ID selected from the interface addresses.

If no router ID is specified for a router when these protocols are enabled, the router ID in the RM module is used by default. The default router ID in the RM module is 0.0.0.0 when the router is not configured with any interface. 
               The rules for selecting a router ID are as follows:
               1. If you set a router ID through this configuration, the set router ID is used. If the router ID is not set, you need to select a router ID according to the following rules:
               (1) If loopback interfaces configured with IP addresses exist, the largest IP address among the IP addresses of the loopback interfaces is selected as the router ID.
               (2) If no loopback interface configured with an IP address exists, the largest IP address among the IP addresses of other interfaces is selected as the router ID, regardless of whether the interface is Up.
               The router ID is reselected only when the interface address that is selected as the router ID is deleted or changed. The router ID is not reselected in any of the following cases:
               a. The interface is Down.
               b. A loopback interface is configured when the IP address of a non-loopback interface is selected as the router ID.
               c. A larger IP address of an interface is configured.
               2. Each VPN instance selects the router ID from the addresses of the interfaces of the VPN instance according to the preceding rules.
               3. When both the AMB and SMB exist on the router, the system backs up the router ID set through the related command and the router ID that is selected from IP addresses of the interfaces. After the active/standby switchover is performed, the system checks the validity of the router ID selected from the interface addresses. If the router ID is invalid, the system reselects a router ID.";

                    networking or RR networking where the BGP next hop is changed, BGP needs to check whether there is an LSP destined for the next hop. If such an LSP is not found, BGP needs to establish an LSP in
